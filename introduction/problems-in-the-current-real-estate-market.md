# Problems in the Current Real-estate Market

## Overview

Conventional real estate platforms or listing pages offer limited, one-sided information, failing to address users' needs to efficiently buy, secure desirable properties, or swiftly sell their own.

The banking sector is grappling with the challenge of Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) and is in dire need of selling mortgage claims swiftly to recover both principal and interest. Presently, however, the process is sluggish due to the involvement of personal connections, resulting in a significant cost for banks to resolve these asset sale issues, ranging between 5% and 10%.

There is currently a lack of real-time matching platforms employing AI to meet customers' expectations when it comes to selling, buying, or renting assets. Presently, individuals typically resort to posting their properties on listing pages and waiting passively for potential customers or agents to reach out for negotiations. This process is both costly and time-consuming, often taking weeks or months to yield satisfactory offers.

Currently, there is no platform facilitating cross-border investment and transactions in land or real estate without the need for physical visits. Moreover, there is a lack of platforms enabling individuals to invest in real estate with minimal amounts, such as $100, contributing to low liquidity in the real estate market. The primary barrier to real estate investment remains the necessity for substantial funds.

## Why Do These Problems Exist?

#### Liquidity problems of real-estate:

Throughout history, real estate has maintained significant value, as evidenced by the singular legal entity confirming ownership. This necessitates substantial investments for individuals to enter the real estate market, posing a formidable barrier for many.

The issue lies in the high value of assets lacking token/NFT capabilities, which would otherwise allow users to purchase or invest in them from anywhere across the globe.

#### Urgent sales off and undervalued properties are not matched:

Before the advent of artificial intelligence, traditional publishing websites merely facilitated the posting of purchase requests or property listings without effectively matching them. These platforms lacked the capability to search through vast internet-based datasets. Consequently, they fall short of providing comprehensive functionalities to assist customers efficiently. Users often find themselves dissatisfied, forced to endure prolonged periods of passive waiting, spanning weeks, months, or even years, to either sell their real estate or acquire desired properties.

#### High cost of middle man and distribution in real-estate:

The real estate industry incurs a significant distribution cost, estimated at 10% to 30% of the property price. Consequently, end-users often find themselves purchasing properties at inflated values. This is due to the necessity for project owners to swiftly secure investments, leading them to sell to wholesalers, who in turn sell to distributors before reaching the end-users at elevated prices.
