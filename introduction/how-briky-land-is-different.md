# How Briky Land is Different

## Obsession Over User Experience

Briky Land is guided by a customer-centric approach in platform development, prioritizing features and designs that ensure user-friendliness. Our platform is constructed akin to the methodology employed by Facebook, utilizing an auto-resizing technique to adapt seamlessly across web and mobile interfaces.

With the aid of advanced AI technology, users can effortlessly create accounts using just their phone numbers or a picture. The AI system then automatically populates the required user information, streamlining the process and enhancing user satisfaction.

When users wish to list a property for sale, they simply need to upload relevant pictures and legal documentation (proof of ownership). Briky Land's AI system intelligently populates all necessary fields, drastically reducing the number of steps required for listing. This streamlined process, which typically takes users between 30 minutes to an hour, is now completed with just a few clicks.

## Utility token and NFT token

The Utility token serves as a means for users to access Briky Land platform services and pay subscription fees at reduced costs compared to cash or bank transfers. Additionally, Utility Tokens can be exchanged for furniture, products, or various other services needed by the user, extending beyond real estate to encompass digital assets, physical products, and other services.

With Utility tokens, users can also engage in real estate investments worldwide, with a minimum investment of $100. This enhances the liquidity of real estate assets and reflects their true future value, which has previously been overlooked.

For instance, consider a user who owns a valuable building in Hong Kong and intends to lease it to Apple for their Asia headquarters. The current value of the building typically reflects only its rental income and land value. However, Briky Land introduces the concept of "Real Estate Derivatives," capturing the potential value that arises from unique advantages such as leasing to Apple, which could potentially generate billions of dollars. This innovative approach to assessing real estate value is expected to shape the future of the industry, with the value being reflected in the market prices of BRIK Utility tokens and NFT tokens.

When demand is high, supply follows suit, but when demand wanes due to prices dipping below market value, there's a scarcity of supply, maintaining token prices at the market's minimum, thus ensuring fair property valuation.

The core Briky Land team comprises primarily blockchain engineers and crypto experts with extensive experience in the field. Their profound understanding of the challenges inherent in constructing a comprehensive platform for transactions amounting to 3,700 billion USD annually is pivotal. This adept team has devised a technology roadmap enabling users to engage in real estate transactions - selling, buying, investing, or renting out - as swiftly as possible, while also facilitating co-investments or transactions with millions of potential buyers worldwide through a blockchain system that guarantees full security and ownership verification.

## Platform Token Economics

The design and conception of the BRIK token are rooted in its multifaceted utility within various aspects of the platform, community, and business models. These contemporary and verified token applications serve to incentivize active participation from users - be they buyers, sellers, community members, or service providers - in the Briky Land ecosystem, platform, and offerings.

### Token Use Cases and Features:

1. Users acquiring the BRIK utility token gain the opportunity to co-invest with a minimum of $100, effectively overcoming the high barriers to entry in global real estate investment.
2. With the BRIK utility token, users can engage in real-time property transactions unmatched by any other platform, leveraging the unique capabilities of the Briky Land platform.
3. By purchasing the BRIK utility token, users can invest in undervalued assets, potentially yielding significant profits as real estate values appreciate over time.
4. NFTs empower users to tokenize their assets, enhancing their value and liquidity, enabling swift sales or transactions at desired prices.
5. NFTs also enable banks and financial institutions to tokenize collateral assets swiftly, facilitating the recovery of Non-Performing Loans.
6. Initial user rewards are provided to incentivize and attract users, along with referral and affiliate rewards to further promote engagement with the platform.

The integration of automation technology into online platforms has marked significant progress across various industries. Particularly, advancements in e-commerce algorithms have led to exponential growth in customer engagement in recent times. Artificial Intelligence (AI) emerges as a pivotal innovation, driving our commitment to prioritize user experience.

As mentioned earlier, AI applications are rapidly enhancing customer service and user experience, surpassing other solutions and bridging gaps in the user journey. Briky Land is actively developing and implementing cutting-edge AI components throughout its platform. Initial efforts will focus on various tasks such as data input, sourcing real estate supply from millions of websites, automated data collection, filtering, and analysis. Concurrently, demand will be gathered from diverse online sources like Google, Facebook, YouTube, and social media platforms, ensuring the swift matching of suitable buyers with sellers and encouraging active usage of the Briky Land website or app.

While the ultimate goal is to automate platform features with minimal human intervention, achieving full autonomy remains a distant objective. Briky Land recognizes the importance of human collaboration alongside AI to drive innovation directly within the platform. A human-in-the-loop approach is crucial for generating high-quality training data, as well as for training and validating algorithms.

The Briky Land community has the opportunity to contribute to both straightforward and essential tasks, such as categorizing and validating platform data, in various features that demand human input. As a token of appreciation for their contributions, all participants in the community receive rewards in Briky Land tokens, thereby enhancing the utility of the token.
