# Use cases

## Overview

The Briky Land token economy, encompassing the BRIK Utility token for platform services and NFTs including Governance Tokens for individual properties, is constructed on frameworks that examine various dimensions of token utility across the platform, community, and business models. Briky Land adopts a feature inspired by the SafeMoon project, alongside numerous utility variables. This feature integrates a token fee mechanism, rewarding token holders, while also fostering additional liquidity and value generation.

Briky Land's focus lies in understanding what renders a token most valuable for its holders. This encompasses various factors, such as investing in undervalued assets with a minimum investment of $100, capital gains resulting from high demand in real estate, or the appreciation of the BRIK token as it enhances liquidity and reflects the full value of real estate (including its derivatives value).

The research conducted by the Briky Land team has revealed that successful tokens offer users tangible actions that either accumulate additional value (e.g., through fees, rewards, or profits from investing in undervalued assets) or save money (e.g., through discounts or reduced transfer expenses compared to bank transfers). Additionally, tokens in such systems are often destroyed or "burned" upon use, thereby reducing supply as demand escalates, consequently driving up the token's value.

Many projects implement one or a combination of these valuable use cases. Briky Land will introduce several of these successful metrics at launch, as they have been identified as contributing to the utility and subsequent value of the token.

## The NFT and Governance Token

The BRIK NFT governance token empowers users to convert their assets into NFTs, ensuring complete ownership and security through blockchain and smart contracts, as previously mentioned.

Upon conversion, the seller's tokens are exchanged for a corresponding number of Governance tokens on the platform. Individuals interested in investment or co-investment can then acquire BRIK utility tokens/coins via their token wallet to purchase assets from sellers, thereby obtaining partial or full ownership of the NFTs.

Once full payments are received and confirmed in the wallet account, the NFTs are transferred partially or entirely to the buyer. Subsequently, a legal process is initiated to establish a joint-stock company and issue an equivalent number of shares matching the number of Governance tokens within the NFTs, thereby validating ownership for each buyer or investor.

Upon completion of the legal procedures, the full tokens are unlocked within the system and transferred to the seller's wallet. NFT owners hold the authority to vote on asset utilization or sale, provided that the voting threshold of 51% or higher is achieved.
